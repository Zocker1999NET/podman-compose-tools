services:
  database:
    image: docker.io/library/mariadb

volumes:
  my_vol:
    labels:
      # - if executed inside a service, commands have the same environment vars available
      # - the volume will be cleared before restoring
      # - the command will always be executed where the volume is mounted
      # - you can access secrets in files by using $(cat $SECRET_FILE)

      # === Backups
      # - backup/restore commands need to write to STDOUT / read from STDIN

      # enable backups of this volume (defaults to true)
      work.banananet.podman.backup.enable: "true"
      # container/service to run commands in (takes precedence over .image)
      # service will ignore .stop if required
      work.banananet.podman.backup.container: database
      # image to use to run commands (by default docker.io/library/debian:stable)
      work.banananet.podman.backup.image: NONE
      # mount target if backup is run in the image (defaults to /_volume)
      work.banananet.podman.backup.mount-target: /myvol
      # will stop compose to backup/restore volume (true/false, true by default)
      work.banananet.podman.backup.stop: "true"
      # backup command, executed in .container/.image
      work.banananet.podman.backup.backup-cmd: >-

        mysql --user=root --password=$MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD

      # === Compressing
      # - both commands must read from STDIN and write to STDOUT
      # - you may also compress inside the orignal container, this allows to compress outside or using another image

      # image to run compress commands in (defaults to host)
      work.banananet.podman.backup.compress-image:  # meaning host
      # command to compress backup (none by default)
      work.banananet.podman.backup.compress-cmd: gzip -9 -
      # command to decompress backup on restore ("<.compress-cmd> -d" or none by default)
      work.banananet.podman.backup.decompress-cmd: gzip -9 -d -
